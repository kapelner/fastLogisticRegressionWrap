Description: Provides very fast logistic regression with inferences plus other useful methods such as a forward stepwise model generator. It is fundamentally a wrapper to the amazing fastLR() method in the RcppNumerical package by Yixuan Qiu et al. that allows their work to be more useful to the community.
